# Instructions for agents

This repository holds the FPSOT internationalization specification.
It covers language tags, locale negotiation and fallback, CLDR formatting, MessageFormat messages, translation files, text direction, and personal names and postal addresses.

- The normative text is in `spec/en/` and `spec/fr/`. Every rule has an ID such as `LOC-001`.
- Follow `skill/SKILL.md` when you work on a product that shows text to people. The spec text wins on any difference.
- Every page exists in English and in French, with the same file name and the same IDs.
- Terms and abbreviations come from the term base of `fpsot-spec-writing`. Add a missing term there first.
- Do not copy text from outside standards. Summarize them in your own words and cite the exact version.
- Commits follow Conventional Commits and are signed. Pull requests are squash-merged.
